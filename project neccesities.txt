**Core Goal:** To create an accessible, user-friendly platform that efficiently connects university students with relevant job and internship opportunities, initially in Uganda, with the potential for global expansion.

### Phase 1: Core Necessities & Feature Breakdown

We need to consider two main types of users, each with their specific needs: **Students** (Job Seekers) and **Employers** (Job Posters).

#### I. For Students (Job Seekers):

1.  **User Authentication & Profile Management:**
    *   **Student Registration/Login:** Easy signup (email/password, or potentially social login like Google/Facebook).
    *   **Student Profile Creation:** A comprehensive profile where students can:
        *   Upload their **CV/Resume** (PDF preferred).

### What's Next? (After this breakdown)

Now that we have a good understanding of *what* we want the website to do, the next step will be to think about *how* we can build it. This is where the technical part comes in. We'll discuss:

1.  **Frontend Technologies:** What users see and interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a framework).
2.  **Backend Technologies:** The "brain" of the application that handles data, logic, and user authentication (a server-side language and framework).
3.  **Database:** Where all the information (user profiles, job listings, applications) is stored.
4.  **Deployment:** How to get your website online for others to use.
